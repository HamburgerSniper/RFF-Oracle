### About the dataset 

    This WiFi signal classification dataset from Northeastern University's GENESYS Laboratory consists of raw IQ samples 
    from 16 different Ettus USRP X310 transmitters (TX) (SDRs) and one B210 receiver (RX). 

    In particular, the WiFi is IEEE802.11a protocol bursts, and recorded in SigMF standard data format. There are 20 million
    samples per class, recorded open air at TX <--> RX separations ranging from 2 feet to 62 feet apart. Refer to the ORACLE d
    dataset link in the last section of this page for links to download the dataset.
